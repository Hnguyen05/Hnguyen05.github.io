#Hello Word

This is my home page! My name is Huy Nguyen and I m a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is Computer Science.

## Computer Science Projects
lab 11 - check command line arguments for secret number (hi-lo game), if not exist then generate random secret number using, and print out message if player won or lost.

Lab 8 - Created vector for arguments and used if statement to validate correct number of argments, then printed customers order.

Lab 7 - Using if state validated arguments, and assigned start/end date to argumens and returned the difference using Julian Day Date Difference function.

Lab 11 - Lab 11 part 2 was actually one of my most favorites, even if it was the most difficult one so far. I felt accomplished being able to do part 2 without help, building the cocepts with if statements based on a concept of the guessing game in a previous lab.

Lab 8 - Secondly, I liked lab 8 part 1 because we first started working using vectors. Vetors and arrays are some of the subjects I'm interested in since I believe they'l be useful in the future, and in this lab we started off with validating arguments in a vector in part 1.

Lab 7 - lab 7 is also one of my favorites because it adds to one of our previous labs on the Julian Day Formula to find the date difference It kind of showed me that there's different ways to eecute or write a code with a previous lab's concet. For example the date were stored in the arguments, instead of getting input after running the file.
